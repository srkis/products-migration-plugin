# products-migration-plugin
Migrate products from remote server into woocommerce shop

This plugin was created for a company which have manny WP shops in manny different countries. When they want to create new shop in new country they have problem with products. So idea was they use just one initital database and when new shop is created, just use migration product plugin and fill new shop database with it. Depends on visitors country, tax will calculated  with visitor country fee, currency simbol will change, as well as price if needed. So, on my server i created PHP  API with test database products, which will return json response depends on params they insert. Of course this is just short version for Demo purposes.
